# Dermacare

## Project Overview 
https://github.com/goyalh4164/Dermacare/assets/84830429/a9d8a997-6e6c-4b94-bb3d-e21299a13a41
* Dermacare is a web-based platform designed to analyze skin conditions based on user uploaded photos. The project provides a user-friendly tool for early detection and diagnosis of skin diseases, enhancing overall skin health awareness. 
* We created this project as a social cause because skin diseases continue to be the 4th leading cause of nonfatal disease burden worldwide. However, it is very difficult to provide better dermatological care to under-served or resource-poor regions in a cost-effective manner owing to the unavailability of efficient diagnostic tools, lack of connectivity, and poor laboratory infrastructure etc. 
* Thus, developing an Artificial intelligence-based tool (through Image processing technique) for preliminary diagnosis of numerous dermatological conditions will prove to be a boon in the health care system.

## Key Features of Project:
* High Accuracy Disease Prediction with Deep Learning: Our website boasts an 80% accurate disease prediction utilizing cutting edge deep learning technology.

* Personalized PDF Report: We provide a comprehensive personalized PDF report for every user, presenting detailed health insights including diagnosis, causes, symptoms, medicines suggestions, and recommendations.

* Email Integration for Report Delivery: Our seamless email integration ensures delivery of the personalized PDF health report to users. This feature enhances user experience, making health information easily accessible.

* Locality Based Hospitals: Our website uniquely offers information about hospitals in the user's locality. This feature ensures swift access to healthcare professionals, adding a practical dimension to our platform.
